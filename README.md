# Analysis_of_World_Population
In this project, I analyze the world's population data from a dataset retrieved from Kaggle. 
The dataset comprises information on world population data from different countries from 1970 to 2022. 



## Questions
* What are the highest and lowest population sizes in the year 2022?
* What countries have a total population that is greater than the average population in 2020? 
* What countries were the most densely populated in 2022?
